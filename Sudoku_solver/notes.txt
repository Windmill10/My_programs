1. determine whether a grid is valid(for each column, row, box)
2. insert all possibilities for each cell
3. solving:
    1. test all possibilities(brute force)
        fill in all cells with only one possibility, revise until complete or 
        all remaining cells have more than one possibility
        start testing all cases

    2. some algorithmic way
        apply standard sudoku solving rules(swordfish etc...)
