algorithm(response, previous guess), takes in two arguments and produces a new value
this value is then stored into current_guess and user responses to it 
then call algorithm(response, current_guess) to come up with a new value, store it into current_guess

1A means that one of the digits in the previous guess is correct, which means that it give more info than 1B
how to utilize that info?
1. compare new_guess with previous guess to find identical digits()
2. find all possibilities that at least x(A) ditgits are in an identical position, in other words, erase all that aren't
